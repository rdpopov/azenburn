# azenburn

A simple colorscheme. Reminiscent on the normal vim theme. Based on [this post], and after some digging, some of the
colors from  this [emacs theme].

Fairly minimal, Mainly green and blue shades

Created with [rktjmp/lush.nvim] and [rktjmp/shipwright.nvim].


## Screenshots
Doesn't have that much support for other things, whatever was in lush
